USE CONTROLS:
->ESC TO PAUSE;
->ENTER/RETURN TO RESUME
->USUAL A,D;
->SPACE TO JUMP THE BALL;
->LEFT/RIGHT ALT TO FIRE WHEN GETTING THE CHANCE TO FIRE THE BULLETS;

Well the task of game is to get the key in the levels and unlock the other scene.
It seems easy which it really is but not that easy too.
Thanks.
